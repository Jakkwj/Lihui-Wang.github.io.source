Taking an opposite standing point of dualism, we take an enactive approach to understanding human cognition. We focus on the interaction between perception and action. On the one hand, we are interested in how humans build up knowledge about the world through explorative action, ranging from basic perception to high-level cognition such as belief. On the other hand, we are interested in how humans make action choices under the guidance of knowledge. We use a combination of techniques such as eye-tracking, EEG, fMRI, and MEG to understand the neural mechanism.
<!-- **The Lab of Enactive Cognition**, led by research associate professor [Lihui Wang](/authors/admin/), is formed in 2020? in [Institute of Psychology and Behavioral Science](https://psy.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn).
The main research interests of the group include:
  - Interaction between perception and action.
  - Rock & roll music? Really?!
  - What ever... -->
